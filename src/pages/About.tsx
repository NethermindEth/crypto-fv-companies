        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Formal Verification in Crypto</h2>
        <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
          Formal verification is a rigorous mathematical approach to proving the correctness and security of software systems, including blockchain and smart contract applications. It involves using formal methods and tools to analyze and verify the behavior of a system against its specified requirements and properties.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">FAQ: Formal Verification vs. Auditing and Testing</h3>
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <details className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md p-4">
              <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How does formal verification differ from auditing and testing?</summary>
              <p className="mt-2">While auditing and testing are important for ensuring the quality and security of software, they have limitations. Auditing is a manual process that relies on human expertise and can be prone to oversights. Testing can only cover a finite number of scenarios and may miss edge cases. Formal verification, on the other hand, uses mathematical proofs to demonstrate the correctness of a system under all possible conditions, providing a higher level of assurance.</p>

            <details className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md p-4">
              <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Where can things go wrong in formal verification?</summary>
              <p className="mt-2">Formal verification is not foolproof. The process can be complex and time-consuming, and errors can occur in the specification of requirements, or the modeling of the system. Additionally, formal verification relies on the correctness of the underlying tools and theories, which may have their own limitations or flaws, though this is on the order of not trusting your compiler in normal software projects - a legitimate but rare concern.</p>
            </details>
            <details className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md p-4">
              <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Where can formal verification provide complete correctness?</summary>
              <p className="mt-2">When done properly, formal verification can provide complete correctness for specific properties or aspects of a system. For example, it can prove the absence of certain types of bugs, such as integer overflows or reentrancy vulnerabilities in smart contracts. It can also verify the correctness of algorithms, protocols, and state machine transitions. However, formal verification cannot guarantee the overall correctness or security of a system, as it is limited to the properties that are specified and proven.</p>

              <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What are ATP and ITP in formal verification?</summary>
              <p className="mt-2">ATP (Automated Theorem Proving) and ITP (Interactive Theorem Proving) are two main approaches to formal verification. ATP systems, such as SMT solvers, automatically search for proofs based on a set of axioms and inference rules. ITP systems, such as Coq and Isabelle/HOL, require users to guide the proof process by providing intermediate steps and proof strategies. ATP is often used for solving specific verification tasks, while ITP is used for more complex and expressive proofs.</p>

              <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What is the formal verification process?</summary>
              <p className="mt-2">The formal verification process typically involves the following steps:</p>
              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
                <li>Understanding the codebase and its requirements</li>
                <li>Developing a formal model of the system</li>
                <li>Defining the properties to be verified</li>
                <li>Extracting the relevant parts of the codebase into the formal model</li>
                <li>Constructing proofs using appropriate tools and techniques</li>
                <li>Publishing the proofs for review and validation</li>
              </ol>
              <p className="mt-2">This process requires expertise in both the problem domain and formal methods, and close collaboration between developers, auditors, and formal verification specialists.</p>
